Hello Git and GitHub
This is the file that I created as a Readme file for the git_practice from my Codecademy Pro account.  
I am studying GitHub repositories once again as a sideline of the Web Development area of Codecademy so that I can become
a better front end developer.  I'm already great at responsive web design and have 3+ years studying.  I started in 2018.
If anybody comes across this Readme, I am looking for some type of dev, design or analytics (graphs).  I have actually done work 
as a virtual analyst for a 'large' company.  
Happy Coding!
